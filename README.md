# REST Assured Java Framework and basic tests

## What do I need to run these samples?
A Java 8 (or greater, in this case I'm using 11) JDK and Maven. That's it.

## What API is used for the samples?
The code samples invoke the Zippopotam.us API.

In those cases where the actual API could not be used (it doesn't support HTTP operations other than GET, plus it doesn't have an option to return XML response bodies), calls have been mocked using WireMock.
